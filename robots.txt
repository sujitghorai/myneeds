# robots.txt for my-needs.in

# This file tells search engine crawlers which pages they can and cannot access.
# It helps optimize crawl budget and prevent indexing of non-public or low-value content.

# --- Global Rules for All User Agents (*) ---
# The asterisk (*) matches all web crawlers.

User-agent: *

# --- Disallow Common Admin and Backend Areas ---
# These sections typically have no public SEO value and can waste crawl budget.
# For WordPress sites, /wp-admin/ and /wp-includes/ are standard disallows.
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Disallow: /wp-includes/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /login/
Disallow: /dashboard/
Disallow: /cgi-bin/

# --- Allow Specific Admin Files (if needed for front-end functionality) ---
# Some front-end features might require access to specific admin files (e.g., admin-ajax.php for WordPress).
# The 'Allow' directive overrides a broader 'Disallow'.
Allow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php

# --- Disallow Internal Search Result Pages ---
# Internal search results often create many unique URLs with duplicate content,
# which can dilute SEO value and waste crawl budget.
Disallow: /?s=
Disallow: /search/
Disallow: /*?query= # Common for custom search implementations

# --- Disallow URLs with Specific Parameters ---
# Useful for e-commerce sites with faceted navigation (filters, sorting),
# or if you have tracking parameters you don't want indexed.
# The `*` acts as a wildcard, `$` matches the end of the URL.
Disallow: /*?filter=
Disallow: /*?sort=
Disallow: /*?order=
Disallow: /*&filter=
Disallow: /*&sort=
Disallow: /*&order=
Disallow: /*?sessionid=

Disallow: /*?utm_medium=
Disallow: /*?utm_campaign=
Disallow: /*?utm_term=
Disallow: /*?utm_content=

# --- Disallow Common WordPress Tag, Category, and Comment Feeds (if not desired for SEO) ---
# These can sometimes create duplicate content or low-value pages.
Disallow: /tag/
Disallow: /category/*/page/ # Blocks pagination for categories
Disallow: /comments/feed/
Disallow: /feed/
Disallow: /trackback/
Disallow: /xmlrpc.php
Disallow: /*/comment-page-*
Disallow: /*?replytocom

# --- Disallow Specific File Types (if they don't add SEO value and consume crawl budget) ---
# Example: Disallowing PDF files if they are not primary content for search.
# Be cautious: Only disallow if you're sure these files should not be indexed.
# Disallow: /*.pdf$
# Disallow: /*.zip$
# Disallow: /*.rar$

# --- Specify the location of your XML sitemap ---
# This helps search engines discover all the important pages on your site.
# Make sure this URL is correct for your sitemap.
